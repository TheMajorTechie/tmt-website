How to Summon Dark Lord (Tirek/Fluttershy/whatever character or OC)

A Story in Which Everything and Everyone is a Cliche Idiot of Generic Stupidity

"Treef"
In which a tree is a thief. Why? Why not?

Approaching Infinity

A Perfect World Cannot Exist.

The Angry Birds crossover nobody asked for or needed

Pitfall

Now do you know how to know what to now?

You've heard of Cinderella, now enter Blender-Smella!

Overdramatic. Opportunistic. Optimistic. Forever.

Twelve Years 'till Midnight

Lists

I See Me

Webkinz crossover (Or, I GOTTA RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN...)

This (really) Shouldn't Work.

The quest to send Celestia hurtling into the sun

By My Own Design
If Twilight can't make new friends, she'll just MAKE them...

Slappety
Probably would be a successor to my long line of one-shot trollfics, honestly.

Something about Celestia being a server admin and Equestria is literally just a chatroom or something like that

Edgelords LLC. - exactly what it sounds like.

Never/Again - two perspectives of a situation

Face/Less

Un/Masked

Whispernot

Pick A Universe - a story about someone who intentionally displaces themselves over and over just to get out of a situation

February Snow

I am (quite literally) radioactive and y'all best stay away from me.

Clip-on ties and a side of fries

The Dog's Blood - think something along the lines of Violet Evergarden's backstory.

Lonely Eternity - Celestia and Luna, long-since retired and removed from Equestrian society, ponder the rest of eternity. Maybe someone pays them a visit.

Horse in the Snow - Flurry Heart reflects on the past and the present as the sole ruler of the Crystal Empire.

Twilight Sparkle claps the cheeks!

Sweetie sets a banana on fire (and other totally normal things)

Strands - something, something, messing with the strands of fate and consequence. Main character is able to enter a dream-like world where they can see and manipulate the fates of those immediately around them, which are visible as strings that connect people/ponies, places, actions, and more.

Blink and you'll miss it
Wink and you'll miss it
Think and you'll miss it

The Council of Y. E. E. T.

My not very interesting life, and the slightly-more interesting consequences of owning a cursed diary.

Celestia sneezes, promptly ending the world and everything on it.

Hear Me. - likely a one-shot, one-on-one story focusing on only two characters' interactions.

Noooo, Trixie doesn't want to be bread! - Nooooooo!

Jack of no trades, master of all - Celestia or some other ruler tries to get a job on the side of ruling the nation.

The Second Surge

Picture Me in Neon Colors

The Lonely Pianist

Worth - a look into what one is worth, be it material or otherwise.

The Half-Chain Rose

Professional Unprofessional

Re:discover - a child one day begins to talk about a previous life, though they themselves are unsure of who they are talking about. This prompts a worldwide search leading to the discovery of a long-forgotten body and legacy.

Life In Boxes (Takes place after Pony-Me, and explores the various uses people have for the simulations)

Goddess Inkarnate</p>
