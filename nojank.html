			  <p class="story-block">"My Own Reality" is the fully original-fiction adaptation of Pony-Me. This is its incomplete first draft.
				<br>
				<br>  Rebecca Waterman thought her life was perfectly normal; a stable, steady life in a quiet suburban neighborhood, good friends and schooling... the works.
				<br>
				<br>	Lisa Garnet thought it was all so real. The people, the grass, everything--right down to her very identity as Rebecca. With the breaking of a single connection, however, it all comes crashing down, leaving nothing in its wake save for a rather confused girl donning a headset.
				<br>
				<br>	Now, the question is... should she return to her blissfully simulated life, or should she turn away, and dig up a buried past she'd once run away from?
